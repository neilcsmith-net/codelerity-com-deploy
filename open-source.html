  <p>Free and open-source software is at the heart of
    <span class="codelerity">codelerity</span>'s work.</p>

  <p>We lead on, contribute to, and work with a broad range of open-source tools.
    Some key projects we work on include -</p>

<section class="software">
  <h2>PraxisCORE / PraxisLIVE</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.praxislive.org/core/">PraxisCORE</a> is a modular,
    real-time recodeable actor system. With a distributed forest-of-actors
    architecture, runtime code changes and comprehensive introspection, PraxisCORE
    brings aspects of Erlang, Smalltalk and Extempore into the Java world ... a
    powerful platform for media processing, data visualisation, sensors, robotics,
    IoT, and lots more!</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.praxislive.org/">PraxisLIVE</a> is a hybrid visual
    live programming IDE for PraxisCORE. Mixing node-based actor visualisation
    with comprehensive live programming support, it blurs the boundaries between
    low-code and traditional development.</p>
  <p>These projects were initiated by <span class="codelerity">codelerity</span>
    founder Neil C Smith, and the technologies within them provide a thread through
    the commercial services we provide.</p>

  <h2>GStreamer (Java)</h2>
  <p><span class="codelerity">codelerity</span> lead development on the
    <a href="https://github.com/gstreamer-java">Java bindings for GStreamer</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> is a powerful and
    flexible pipeline-based multimedia framework. It can be used for a broad range
    of purposes across client, server and embedded, including playback, streaming,
    analysis, machine learning, real-time communication, and more.</p>
  <p>Our clients work with GStreamer and Java across a wide range of sectors
    including broadcast media, live events, machine learning, agriculture,
    in-flight systems, medical imaging, security and defence.</p>

<section class="software">
  <h2>Apache NetBeans</h2>
  <p>Weâ€™re active participants in the development of the Apache NetBeans platform
    and IDE. <span class="codelerity">codelerity</span> founder Neil C Smith is a
    member of the Apache NetBeans PMC and Apache Software Foundation, and is
    particularly active on the release team for the IDE.</p>
  <p>We work with clients to provide custom development and support for their
    applications built on top of the NetBeans platform.</p>
  <p>Between 2021 and 2025 we worked with Gj IT to provide community installers
    for the IDE. These have now moved to the
    <a href="https://installers.friendsofapachenetbeans.org/" target="_blank">Friends
      of Apache NetBeans</a> foundation. We are working with the foundation to
      transfer, automate and support the ongoing provision of these packages.</p>
