  <p>Free and open-source software is at the heart of
    <span class="codelerity">codelerity</span>'s work.</p>

  <p>We lead on, contribute to, and work with a broad range of open-source tools.
    Some key projects we work on include -</p>

<section class="software">
  <h2>PraxisCORE / PraxisLIVE</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.praxislive.org/core/">PraxisCORE</a> is a modular,
    real-time recodeable actor system. With a distributed forest-of-actors
    architecture, runtime code changes and comprehensive introspection, PraxisCORE
    brings aspects of Erlang, Smalltalk and Extempore into the Java world ... a
    powerful platform for media processing, data visualisation, sensors, robotics,
    IoT, and lots more!</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.praxislive.org/">PraxisLIVE</a> is a hybrid visual
    live programming IDE for PraxisCORE. Mixing node-based actor visualisation
    with comprehensive live programming support, it blurs the boundaries between
    low-code and traditional development.</p>
  <p>These projects were initiated by <span class="codelerity">codelerity</span>
    founder Neil C Smith, and the technologies within them provide a thread through
    the commercial services we provide.</p>

  <h2>GStreamer (Java)</h2>
  <p><span class="codelerity">codelerity</span> lead development on the
    <a href="https://github.com/gstreamer-java">Java bindings for GStreamer</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> is a powerful and
    flexible pipeline-based multimedia framework. It can be used for a broad range
    of purposes across client, server and embedded, including playback, streaming,
    analysis, machine learning, real-time communication, and more.</p>

  <h2>Apache NetBeans</h2>
  <p>We’re active participants in the development of the Apache NetBeans platform

    member of the Apache NetBeans PMC and Apache Software Foundation, and is
    particularly active on the release team for the IDE.</p>
  <p>We work with clients to provide custom development and support for their
    applications built on top of the NetBeans platform.</p>
